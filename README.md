# Hi there, I'm Leesa McLemore! ðŸ‘‹

Leesa is a photographer, graduate student, and aspiring designer. In December of 2014, she completed her BFA with an emphasis in Studio Arts and Photography from Southern Utah University. She is currently working on attaining an MS Graphic Information Technology degree from Arizona State University online. 

Over the last 10 years, Leesa has worked as a adjunct professor, freelance photographer, social media coordinator, and an instructional assistant in elementary and middle schools. After graduation, she hopes to use her new education, along with her prior experience, to work in user experience, design, or possibly education. In her downtime, she can be found with her husband and 3 kids at the family cabin, fishing, hiking, or doing a puzzle.
